# Tuning_RandomizedSearch

I will upload the code I have written for hyper paramter optimization of several algorithms used in [this](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recruit-restaurant-visitor-forecasting) Kaggle competition.

Randomized search perfomrs drastically better than grid search. Please see [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_randomized_search.html).
